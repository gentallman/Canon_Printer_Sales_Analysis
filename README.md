- Created a dashboard by merging several pivot charts into a single space. The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profit in percentage and dollars, and total units sold. It also highlights the most sold product ID along with its sales value in dollars.

- The sales and profit (%) chart by month reveals a significant spike in sales every January. The sales by province chart shows that Nova Scotia leads in sales, while Prince Edward Island contributes only 1% of the total sales among the provinces.

- A scroller allows users to view sales data for five customers at a time. Additionally, there are treemap visuals that display the sales percentage breakdown by segment, with the government sector accounting for the highest sales at 44%, followed by small businesses at 35.74%.

- A line chart depicts the profit generated over the months in 2021 and 2022, showing that 2022 had higher sales, with a notable rise after February 2022, a massive drop in October, and a recovery afterward.

- Thereâ€™s also a pie chart displaying the percentage split of units sold by product code, and a sunburst chart showing the sales of these products in 2021 and 2022.
